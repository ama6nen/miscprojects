	notes
---------------------
[fully working]
when something says it is fully working, it means its identical to how it would be to be in real GT.
That means its not something that works but it also works EXACTLY how it should be.
It means you should not be able to tell it apart from real gt.
It also means the dialogs are EXACTLY like in real gt.

[ghetto]
when something something says its ghetto, it means it works but you can tell it apart from real gt.
this could mean that the dialog is altered, something is simplified due to laziness, etc

------------------------------
 features currently in server
------------------------------
-not based on anybodys (growtopia noobs) code at all
-server shouldn't crash as generalized functions always check for validity first, in the case it does though, everything is traced.
-database using mysql instead of ghetto json
-framework has a lot of capabilities already developed to add new features quickly, and implementing&deploying them is fast
-integrated http server into the server, which serves custom cache files, and can determine file request abuse and allocate resources intelligently

-fully working proper block drops (seeds & blocks drop at same rate as in real server)
-fully working proper block breaking with proper cooldown and hits to break
-fully working proper item drops and collecting
-fully working proper gems (not adding to ur gem count with onsetbux)
-fully working proper tree support with exact growth and tree fruit calculations
	-NOTE: grow spray and deluxe grow spray have both been buffed to grow 24 times more than in real gt. So normal one grows 1 day, deluxe 24 days.
-fully working splicing for all trees
-fully working accurate tree drops
-fully working trashing and recycling
-fully working info/descriptions with all of the properties, rarity, and etc
-dropping (difference: our dropping system doesn't let you drop as close to a collideable tile as gt, you have to be around 16 pixels away
at minimum for dropping to work, meanwhile gt has it as 8 pixels (roughly). block drops will drop even if there is something there already,
as well, as we thought it was dumb to restrict drops just because some other thing happens to be dropped there already, and its identical otherwise)
-fully working movement
-growmojis (note: some ways of gaining them are different, like the ones gained from monthly bundles, are instead unlocked by leveling up.)
-fully working worlds that already serialize all but 6 block types
-fully working respawning (both spikes/in block and actual respawn)
-fully working lava/cactus/etc damage
-fully working skin color changing
	-skin color level checks according t o supporter/ssupporter status
	-playmods have additive skin coloring that gt has too (ex. tomato + egg = orangish, egg + blueberry = gray)
-fully working billboards
-fully working infecting mechanic
-fully working leveling and xp (note: as fishing and such activities are yet not implemented you cannot earn xp by them)
	- the xp earned is exactly same as in real gt (except added benefits), and so are the level requirements
	- current ways of earning xp: breaking blocks, harvesting trees, using consumables, placing blocks
	- you also earn xp by placing blocks though, although half what you would when breaking.
	- this is to make leveling faster as people aren't going to spend as much time in private servers as in real one.
